Move the code you previously wrote to calculate how many seconds are in a year into this file.
Then execute it as a script to see the output printed to your console.

days_in_year = 365
hours_in_day = 24
minutes_in_hour = 60
seconds_in_minute = 60
seconds_in_year = days_in_year * hours_in_day * minutes_in_hour * seconds_in_minute

print(str(seconds_in_year) + " seconds in one year")
